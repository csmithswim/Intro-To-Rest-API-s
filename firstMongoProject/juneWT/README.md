This project contains several different programs and files for a full stack application using NPM, Node, Javascript, and Pug. The back end sever and database programming was done using node and different NPM's such as express, mongoose, morgan, validator and Nodemon. All CRUD route handlers were programmed using Node/Javascript that allowed a sever to be run using express and movie titles and different movie values to be PUT/Patched to a database using MongoDB. We then displayed our data dynamically using a templating engine such as pug. An administrative route was made if we wanted to access a movie given a specific ID and make any editing on the front end. JSON web token technology was last added to our program to allow users to have an encrypted password and store passwords in our database. We made two different middleware programs that would authorize a user or admin to perform different API requests to our database. The middelware checked that their email and passwords were valid on the front end and back end and subsequently used JWT to authorize them to make different api requests. Some of these requests include patching information to our Movies database collection, adding movies to the collection and also renting movies.
